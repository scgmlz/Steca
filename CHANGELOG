Steca version 2.1.1, released 2019.01.23
----------------------------------------

Corrections:

* Export to ".pol" format restored
* Diagram export added or restored
* Start header line in diagram and table export with "#"
* Warnings only shown when catched

Internal improvements:

* New version of libcerf
* Caching simplified, unused classes removed
* YAML loader simplified, unused functions removed
* Cleaner CMake, now requiring v3.6

Steca version 2.1.0, released 2018.11.15
----------------------------------------

New features:

* Single measurements (or groups) can be deselected
* Table, diagram and polefigure are now tabs in the main frame
* Improved control tabs for detector, peaks, interpolation
* Diffractograms can be saved into multiple, numbered files
* Copy&paste from rectangular selections in data tables (re?)enabled.
* All user actions are logged

Internal improvements:

* Qt signals are captured by widget wrappers. Everywhere else, Qt signals
  are replaced by explit function calls. All computation intensive data
  are cached. In this way, unnecessary computations are avoided. This
  results in a huge speed gain.
* For testing purposes, widgets can be driven from the command line
* Decoupled "highlighting" (one measurement group) from "selecting" (most or all measurements).
* Logic moved from table models to datasets.
* Unified exception handling.
* Doxygen comments for all files, namespaces, and classes.

Steca version 2.0.6, released 2018.01.19
----------------------------------------

Changes:

* Removed start-up dialog.
  * Check for update must now be triggered through Help > Check for update.
  * Extended 'About' window with notes on citation.
* Changed structure of hidden settings files. Settings from previous release will be lost.
* Tooltip in files list

Besides that, there are no intentional changes of functionality.
Internally, however, the code has been thoroughly reworked, in order to facilitate
long-term maintenance. Therefore, this release needs to be extensively tested.

Steca version 2.0.5, released 2017.12.06
----------------------------------------

New features:

* an option to switch between averaging and summing intensities in histograms
* simple zooming in the histogram graph

Improvements:

* some code cleanup (transiting to new maintainer's taste)
* Better sorting of the table of pole figure points.
* Table of pole figure points does not auto-select the alpha & beta columns
* "open files" dialog caches the file type information
* read new STRESS-SPEC metadata
* all file dialogs are now uniformly looking

Bug fixes:

* Correctly enabled fallback to idw if pole figure point interpolation
  by averaging fails

Steca version 2.0.4, released 2016.12.01
----------------------------------------

New features:

* image overlay: visualise gamma slices and 2theta bins;
  show where gamma=0 is
* the "about" dialog indicates if the build is 64-bit;
  startup options reset after a new version is installed
  (to alert the user to that fact)

Improvements:

* raw diffractogram (before background adjustment) is plotted as dots
  (to show the nature of the histogram binning)
* detector geometry defaults to 1035 / 1 mm
* image color scale adjusted to show lower counts more clearly
* add/remove file buttons moved above the file list

Bug fixes:

* more conservative memory allocation that, we hope, fixes the strange
  "bad allocation" errors on some machines
* utf8 (Greek) characters replaced by ASCII strings (e.g. "gamma")
  in output text files

Steca version 2.0.3a (hotfix), released 2016.11.14
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

* fixed incorrect calculation of bin numbers for combined datasets
* non-used configuration entries (detector) temporarily hidden

Steca version 2.0.3, released 2016.11.11
----------------------------------------

New features:

* check updates; optionally at startup
* loads TIFF data format
* loads Mar data format
* handles beam offset
* option to disable gamma-slicing
* option to disable neutron count averaging (experimental)

Improvements:

* optimized angle map calculation
* improved image display resizing
* image overlay shows beam centre crosshairs
* Metadata view is a table view
* more compact gui layout
* X button that clears reflections
* progress bar shows the progress of pole figure points interpolation
* gamma slicing shown in images

Bug fixes:

* #28 - a bug in vanadium correction

Steca version 2.0.2a (hotfix), released 2016.08.29
--------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

* vanadium correction re-enabled for diffractograms
* fixed labels in diffractogram output

Steca version 2.0.2, released 2016.08.23
----------------------------------------

New features:

* #23 - normalisation to monitor count

Bug fixes:

* #22 - missing values in saved diagrams
* Diagrams of RAW reflection values are output without (meaningless) error limits.
* "all datasets" curve works

Changes, improvements:

* The range of gammas is now retrieved at the 'middle' 2 theta.
* Output text files are written with OS-specific end-of-line (\r\n on Windows).
* Output text formats: only .dat (spaces) and .csv (commas); .txt is discontinued.
* Output dialogs: improved gamma slicing controls.

Steca version 2.0.1, released 2016.06.29
----------------------------------------

New features:

* Datasets with different 2theta and/or gamma values (i.e. angle maps) are now properly combined.
* Some relevant warnings are now shown on the statusbar.

Bug fixes:

* #1442 - crash when normalizing to invalid monitor counts or delta time
* #1443 - NaN errors shown by the diffractogram plot

Changes in code:

* statubar-messaging
* semi-major code refactoring, rearranged modules and source code files
* new specialized types and typedefs to improve type safety and self-documentation of code
* cache classe to handle angle maps
* Fixed bugs #1442, #1443, and a number of small things

STeCa2-2.0.0.1, released 2016.06.09
-----------------------------------
* First release for user acceptance testing
